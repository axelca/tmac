        THE MIND ACTION CONFLICT is born out of the urge to leave the mind for
        actions. When the projects founder Elias became a dad in 2018 he
        realised that the time and timing to proceed the dream to write and
        record music within a band would never come until he made it happen.

        After spending off-time experimenting with sounds, recording and
        production he slowly found the the core DNA of the embryo he wished turn
        into a band. A sound with a strong feel of ”larger than life”.

          As much as the name the project is about leaving the identity of
          thoughts for movement of actions. A theme that is recurring in both
          mood and lyrics of the new single <i>”Fantasy”(14th April).</i>
