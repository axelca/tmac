        THE MIND ACTION CONFLICT is born out of the urge to leave the mind for
        actions. Singer and founder of the band Elias has a long love story with
        Cuba. Naturally introduced to the island by the mother of his child 7
        years ago, Elias formed a strong bond to its people and their outlook on
        life. It became a new home away from home.

        In Santa Clara’s inclusive atmosphere, with its typical Social Clubs and
        spontaneous jam sessions by local musicians, Elias identified a personal
        longing to dig deep from within and create something new and honest. The
        eclectic fusion between Scandinavian rock traditions and the Caribbean
        collectivistic musical atmosphere ended up founding THE MIND ACTION
        CONFLICT.

          After experimenting with sounds, recording and producing, Elias slowly
          found the core he wished to turn into a band. A sound with a
          larger-than-life-feel. And just like the name, this project is about
          leaving the identity of thoughts for movement of actions. A theme that
          is recurring in both mood and lyrics of the new single{" "}
